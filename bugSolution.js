The solution to this bug often requires careful review of both your project's configuration files (`app.json`, `eas.json`, and any platform-specific configuration like `android/app/build.gradle`) and the documentation for any third-party libraries that utilize native code. 

Steps for debugging and resolution:
1. **Verify Native Module Installation**: Ensure your native module is correctly installed via npm or yarn. Check the module's documentation for specific installation instructions. 
2. **Check EAS Build Configuration**: Review your `eas.json` file to make sure that any native module-related configuration is correct. This might include specifying build configurations or dependencies. 
3. **Examine Build Logs**: Examine EAS build logs carefully for any clues or warnings, even those that may seem unrelated.  Sometimes the error originates in a seemingly unrelated part of the build process. 
4. **Android Specifics**: For Android, pay special attention to your `android/app/build.gradle` file to ensure all dependencies are declared, and native modules are properly linked.
5. **iOS Specifics**: For iOS, review your Xcode project settings to ensure the native modules are correctly integrated. 
6. **Clean Build**: After making changes, always perform a clean build to remove any cached or outdated build artifacts.
7. **Simplify**: If you have many native modules, try disabling or removing them one by one to isolate the problematic module.
