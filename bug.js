This error typically occurs when using Expo's managed workflow with EAS Build. The issue arises because the build process cannot locate or properly handle required native modules or dependencies within your project.  This often manifests when you have added custom native modules, used a library that relies on native code, or have an incorrect configuration in your `app.json` or `eas.json` files.  The error message itself might be vague, sometimes simply indicating a failed build without specific details. 

Example Scenario:
Suppose you've integrated a native library for camera access which is not properly configured for EAS Build. The build process will fail silently, or with a general native module error.
